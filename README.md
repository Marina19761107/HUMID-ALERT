# HUMID-ALERT
The proposed project is an Automated Humidity Alert System designed to monitor indoor humidity and temperature levels using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a Sense HAT. The system helps maintain a stable home environment by notifying the user when humidity exceeds a defined threshold (50%).
